# politivector.github.io

This repository belongs to the old edition of Politivector, which you can still access at [politivector.github.io](https://politivector.github.io/). We won't be updating this edition, though we plan to keep it online for now.

## New Politivector

The reason deprecated this repository is because we moved the hosting from GitHub Pages to our own address, [politivector.com](https://www.politivector.com/). Politivector is still an open source project, and you can reach the new repository at [github.com/Ankyrian/politivector](https://github.com/Ankyrian/politivector).
